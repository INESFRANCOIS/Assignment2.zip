class Agent :

"""
This class simulates movements of bacteria according the current wind and turbulances.

The constructors has two arguments: 
environment (a list of list representing the city in which agents are located) 
bacteria (a list of bacteria in the environment) 

Bacteria have four characteristics : name, x-coordinate, y-coordinate and z-coordinate.

There are two functions to simulate movements of bacteria: move and turbulance.
